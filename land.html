                    <li><p><em>St. Sophia Cathedral</em> is one of the few surviving buildings of the Kyivan Rus’ time. It is a monument of architecture and monumental painting of the second decade of the 11th century (1011–1018). Today a lot of open-air concerts, as well as art expositions, are organized in the cathedral grounds.</p></li>
                    <li><p><em>Andrew's Descent</em> is one of the oldest ways connecting the Upper Town, its central part, with the trade area Podil. Many famous figures of science and culture: scholars, writers, composers, painters, sculptors lived and worked here.</p>
                        <p>The street is known for its art festivals and exhibitions. People come here to listen to street musicians and watch costume shows. The buildings along the street are occupied by art galleries, exhibitions, theaters, and art workshops. Also there are numerous souvenir shops.</p>

                For party lovers
                <p><em>Podil.</em> Artisans’ district in times of the Kyivan Rus‘. Today it’s home to hipsters and ravers. Start your evening somewhere on the junction of Yaroslavska and Mezhyhirska streets, choose a bar, start drinking, start talking, ask those around you for tips.</p>
                <p><em>The only minus is that you can miss your flight back. Even if it was in a week.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                For brutalist and socialist modernist architecture lovers
                <p>You’ll be amazed how many strange but beautiful buildings you can find in less than obvious locations around Kyiv. For example, take a look at this UFO or skyscraper which met the Soviet bureaucracy</p>
